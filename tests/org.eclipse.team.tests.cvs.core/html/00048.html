There are a couple of reasons someone may want to synchronize with the remote. There are currently
two ways of running the refresh operation:
<ul>
<li>Directly from the synchronize view
<li>From Team > Synchronize with Repository
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Notice a file is out-of-sync in another view (e.g. packages explorer, types) and want to see the changes</h3>
<p>In case you can select a file, it will be refreshed with the server, and if changes are found the compare editor is opened
that will allow browsing the changes. If no changes are found, you will be prompted.</p>

<h3>From another view would like to browse the outgoing/incoming changes for several resources</h3>
<p>Select a folder or group of files and Team > Synchronize will open the sync view and automatically refresh with
the remote repository.</p>

<h3>In the sync view and would like to refresh to see if there are new changes from the server</h3>
<p>

</p>

Assumption, the sync view may or may not be open when the synchronize is performed. Maybe we need a different prompt
each case. One for Team > Sync and another for refresh from the sync view.
