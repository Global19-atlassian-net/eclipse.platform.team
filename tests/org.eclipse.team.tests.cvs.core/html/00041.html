Comparing
-> Team > Synchronize with Repository... (file, folder)
	- prompt at the end with list of NEW changes found
	- select sync'd files/folders in the sync view and the sync view is shown
	- optional: could open any file editors if files where in the selection to refresh

-> Team > Merge (file, folder)
 	- this is really a 3-way compare, so somewhat similar to the other 2-way compare shown below
 	- could show complete compare in the wizard, and similarly to compare, allow option for remembering the merge

-> Compare With > Two other branches or versions (file, folder) [note: this is meant to be a quick way of comparing two lineups you don't have locally. instead of having to browse the repo view all the time]
-> Compare With > Another branch/version (file, folder)
-> Compare With > Revision (file)

Options:
-> sync view
	(is long lived, model updates, separates sync overview from browsing changes)
-> modal dialog
	(model is simple, user performs task then dis-misses dialog, cons is that the user can't do anything else)
	- provide option of keeping compare around (e.g. put into sync view)
-> compare editor
    (same as model dialog but user expects the local side to stay in sync with local resources changes made outside,
    these aren't used anymore, instead if local is editable, use sync view).

Features:
- ensure editor/dialog title
- ensure left/right labels and images are ok
- ensure editable property is ok
- ensure save behavior
- can you see the history for each file?
