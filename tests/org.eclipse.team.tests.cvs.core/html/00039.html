You should be able to select a project/folder/resource and compare againts
another branch or version. Multi-select should work across projects in 
different repositories. Once the comparison is shown it should be possible to
merge changes into the local workspace.</p>
<p>
We should support multi-selection of files, but I'm not sure what should be
shown to the user in those cases.</p>
<h3>Comparing with another branch or version</h3>
<ul>
<li>one file selected
<p>If the file has differences open a compare editor and show then. Otherwise notify the user that the files are
the same. You should be able to see the details about the file you are comparing (revision, date, name, repo)</p>
<li>multiple files selected
<p>Same as 'one file selected' but operate on all selected files. This means that multiple compare editors may be opened
for each file that is different.</p>
<li>one folder selected
<p>Entire contents of the folder are compared deep. If changes are found the user is notified and they are
shown in a dialog. If no changes are found the user is notified. The dialog should allow the user to browse
the changes and merge anything into his workspace. If the user wants to keep the comparison non-model, he
can add it to the synchronize view. There is a button to do so on the compare dialog.</p>
<li>mixture of files and folders selected
<p>Same as 'one folder selected' case above.</p>
