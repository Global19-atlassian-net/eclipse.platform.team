<ol>
<li>Choose Team>Branch from the context menu of the Navigator.
<li>Enter a branch tag.
<li>Verify that a version tag is proposed for the branch
<li>Click OK and verify that the tags are applied and the local project is mapped to the branch

Some things to try:
<ul>
	<li>Uncheck the "start working on branch" option and verify that the local project is not moved to the branch.
	<li>Branch a loaded version and verify that the tag from the project is used as the root.
	<li>Ensure that the content assist on the branch text widget shows branches from other projects in the workspace
	that do not exist on the project being branched.
	<li>Branch with local changes and ensurethat they remain and can be committed to the branch
</ul>
