Discovered tags are cached locally to improve performance. Caching is done in the following ways:

<ol>
<li>Tags discovered for local resources are cached with the rmeote folder that the resource's project is mapped to.
<li>Tags discovered for remote resources are cached with the resource if it is a folder or the resource's parent if it is a file.
</ol>

To test this, you can try one or more of the following:
<ol>
<li>Perform Compare With on folders and subfolders in the repositories view. The first time, you will need to perform a Refresh \
but subsequent times, the tags should be cached.
<li>Load non-root folders as projects and ensure tags are cached and obtained properly.
<li>Perform Tag with Existing in the History view and ensure that tags are obtained from the file
</ol>
