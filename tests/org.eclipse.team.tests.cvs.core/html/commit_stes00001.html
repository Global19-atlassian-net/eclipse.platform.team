<h3>Commit Sets for incoming changes</h3>

To perform these scenarios you will need to get one or more projects 
in your workspace that have many incoming changes. Perferably
all the changes will have commit comments and some files will share
a comment. Once you have this setup, you can perform the following sub-scenarios.

<h4>Enabling/disabling Commit Sets</h4>
<ol>
<li>Synchronize the projects with HEAD, enable commit set mode and
ensure that the files appear in the proper commit sets. Also ensure that 
the proper sub-layout is used by expanding some of the nodes in the tree.
<p>
<li>With some nodes expanded and additionally one or more selected, 
disable Commit Sets. The same nodes should remain expanded and selected.
<p>
<li>With the same nodes selected and expanded, re-enable commit sets.
The expansion should remain. There may be more expanded if the same
expanded project or folder appears in multiple commit sets. The selection
will remain unless there are two entries for the same resource (i.e. if a project
was selected and it apears in multiple sets, it will no longer be expanded).
</ol>
You should also confirm that markers and conflicts are properly propogated to
parent nodes.
<h4>Commit Set Layouts</h4>
Now try the various sub-layouts (Flat, Tree and Compressed) and ensure that switching
is performant and that the resulting tree nodes are correct.

<h4>Commit Set Modes</h4>
<ol>
<li>Switch between the various modes and ensure that the displayed nodes are correct.
Also ensure that expansion and seleciton is maintained.
<li>Add a conflict and repeat the above, ensuring the results are correct.
Note that a conflict will appear twice in each mode, once within an incoming
commit set and once within the outgoing commit set (more on this below).
</ol>

<h4>Updating</h4>
With several nodes expanded, perform an update on one or more files
that are incoming changes.
Ensure that the updated files are removed from the view and that 
other expanded nodes remain expanded.

<h3>Outgoing Commit Sets</h3>

The following aspects of outgoing commit sets should be tested.
<ol>
<li>Modified files can be added to a new or existing commit set. Ensure that
when they are added, he file remains visible in the Sync view.
<li>Files in a commit set can be transfered to another commit set
<li>If there is a default commit set, any modified file that is not already
part of a commit set is placed in the default set. Files that are already
in a set should stay in that set if more changes are made to the files.
<li>The title and comment of a commit set can be changed.
<li>Layout and modes changes work properly for outgoing commit sets in the
Synchronize view.
<li>Commiting one or more files in a commit set will result in a commit 
dialog that is primed with the comment from the set.
<li>Commit sets (including which is the default), are preserved accross restarts.
</ol>
