<p>Actions and utilities for use with the Eclipse Synchronize View.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package contains actions that are used by subclasses of <b>TeamSubscriberParticipant</b>.
<br>
</p>
<p>The class <b>TeamSubscriberParticipant</b> provides an
implementation of a synchronize participant that enables
synchronization for a <b>Subscriber</b>. For providers that implement
a <strong>Subscriber</strong>, this is the easiest method of
integrating into the Synchronize View. The TeamSubscriberParticipant
provides a view of changes (incoming, outgoing, conflicting), modes for
showing only a subset of the changes, decorations for identifying the
changes, and working sets. Here are the steps for creating a
participant based on the TeamSubscriberParticipant implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a concrete subclass of <strong>TeamSubscriber</strong>
that will provide the physical connection between the workspace
resources and the remote location that is used to share the resources.</li>
  <li>Subclass <strong>TeamSubscriberParticipant</strong> and provide
concrete implementations for init(QualifiedName), saveState(), and
optionally createPage().</li>
  <li>To add actions to the context menu of the participant page you
must create a viewerContribution in your plugin.xml with the targetID
field equal to that of the qualifier part of the participant's type id.
For example:
    <pre>&lt;viewerContribution id="org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant.actions"      <br> targetID="org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant"</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To add participant specific actions to the view's action bar,
subclass TeamSubscriberParticipantPage and implement setActionBars().</li>
  <li>To add participant specific decorations to the viewer, subclass
TeamSubscriberParticipantPage and implement getLabelProvider().</li>
</ul>
