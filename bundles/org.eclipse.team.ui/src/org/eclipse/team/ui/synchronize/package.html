<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse Synchronize View.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Team UI plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces
to support a generic synchronize view that can show multiple
synchronize participants. This package contains a generic abstract
synchronize participant that provides the common functionality for
synchronize participants. The basic model for the Synchronize View APIs
is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ISynchronizeManager manages registered synchronize
participants. There can be several instances of the same participant
type.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant is a logical representation of a
connection between workspace resources and a remote location used to
shared those resources.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeView is a page book view of participants.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant must create a page that will be
displayed in the ISynchronizeView page book view.</li>
  <li>The ISynchronizeView shows a drop-down of all registered
participants and allows switching between them.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant can contribute actions to the toolbar,
menus, and view menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronize participants are declared by extending the <strong>synchronizeParticipants
</strong>extension point. There are two classes of synchronize
participants: <em>static </em>participants will be created when the
synchronize view is created, and <em>dynamic</em> participants that
are created by user code at some other time. A synchronize manager (<b>ISynchronizeManager</b>)
manages all active synchronize participants, and provides notification
of participants which are added and removed. Participants are displayed
in a page book view. Each participant implementation is reponsible for
creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which provides freedom of
presentation to the synchronize view implementation. A single
participant may be displayed simultaneously in multiple synchronize
views, and in different workbench windows.</p>
