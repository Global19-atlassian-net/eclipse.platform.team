<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse Synchronize View.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Team UI plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces to support 
  a generic synchronize view that can show multiple synchronize participants. 
  This package contains a generic abstract synchronize participant that provides 
  the common functionality for synchronize participants. The basic model for the 
  Synchronize View APIs is the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ISynchronizeManager manages registered synchronize participants.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant is a logical representation of a connection between 
    workspace resources and a remote location used to shared those resources.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeView is a page book view of participants.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant must create a page that will be displayed in the 
    ISynchronizeView page book view.</li>
  <li>The ISynchronizeView shows a drop-down of all registered participants and 
    allows switching between them.</li>
  <li>A ISynchronizeParticipant can contribute actions to the toolbar, menus, 
    and view menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>Synchronize participants are declared by extending the <strong>synchronizeParticipants 
  </strong>extension point. There are two classes of synchronize participants: 
  <em>static </em>participants will be created when the synchronize view is created, 
  and <em>dynamic</em> participants that are created by user code at some other 
  time. A synchronize manager (<b>ISynchronizeManager</b>) manages all active 
  synchronize participants, and provides notification of participants which are 
  added and removed. Participants are displayed in a page book view. Each participant 
  implementation is reponsible for creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which 
  provides freedom of presentation to the synchronize view implementation. A single 
  participant may be displayed simultaneously in multiple synchronize views, and 
  in different workbench windows.</p>
<p>The class <b>TeamSubscriberParticipant</b> provides an implementation of a 
  synchronize participant that enables synchronization for a <b>TeamSubscriber</b>. 
  For providers that implement a <strong>TeamSubscriber</strong>, this is the 
  easiest method of integrating into the Synchronize View. The TeamSubscriberParticipant 
  provides a view of changes (incoming, outgoing, conflicting), modes for showing 
  only a subset of the changes, decorations for identifying the changes, and working 
  sets. Here are the steps for creating a participant based on the TeamSubscriberParticipant 
  implementation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a concrete subclass of <strong>TeamSubscriber</strong> that will 
    provide the physical connection between the workspace resources and the remote 
    location that is used to share the resources.</li>
  <li>Subclass <strong>TeamSubscriberParticipant</strong> and provide concrete 
    implementations for init(QualifiedName), saveState(), and optionally createPage().</li>
  <li>To add actions to the context menu of the participant page you must create 
    a viewerContribution in your plugin.xml with the targetID field equal to that 
    of the qualifier part of the participant's id. For example: 
    <pre>&lt;viewerContribution id=&quot;org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant.actions&quot;      
 targetID=&quot;org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant&quot;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>To add participant specific actions to the view's action bar, subclass TeamSubscriberParticipantPage 
    and implement setActionBars().</li>
  <li>To add participant specific decorations to the viewer, subclass TeamSubscriberParticipantPage 
    and implement getLabelProvider().</li>
</ul>
