<p>Application programming interfaces for interaction
with the Eclipse Synchronize View.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>The Eclipse Team UI plug-in provides a set of classes and interfaces to
support a generic synchronize view that can show multiple synchronize 
participants. This package contains a generic abstract synchronize participant 
that provides the common functionality for synchronize participants.
Clients implementing synchronize participants should subclass this 
<b>AbstractSynchronizeParticipant</b>.</p>
<p>Synchronize participants must be declared by extending the <strong>synchronizeParticipants 
  </strong>extension point. There are two classes of synchronize participants: 
  static participants will be created when the synchronize view is created, and 
  dynamic participants are created by user code at some other time. </p>
<p>A synchronize manager (<b>ISynchronizeManager</b>) manages all active synchronize 
  participants, and provides notification of participants which are added and 
  removed. Participants are displayed in a page book view. Each participant implementation 
  is reponsible for creating its page (<b>IPageBookView</b>), which provides freedom 
  of presentation to the synchronize view implementation. A single participant 
  may be displayed simultaneously in multiple synchronize views, in different 
  workbench windows.</p>
<p>The class <b>TeamSubscriberParticipant</b> provides an implementation of a 
  synchronize participant that enables synchronization for a <b>TeamSubscriber</b>. 
  For providers that implement a <strong>TeamSubscriber</strong> this is the easiest 
  method of integrating into the Synchronize View. The steps would be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a concrete subclass of <strong>TeamSubscriber</strong>.</li>
  <li>Subclass <strong>TeamSubscriberParticipant</strong> and provide concrete 
    implementations for init(QualifiedName) and saveState().</li>
  <li>Add actions to the context menu of the participant by creating a viewerContribution 
    in your plugin.xml with the targetID field equal to that of your participants 
    qualifier part of their id. For example: 
    <pre>&lt;viewerContribution id=&quot;org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant.actions&quot;      
 targetID=&quot;org.eclipse.myteamplugin.syncparticipant&quot;&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Add actions to the view's action bar by appending them via the TeamSubscriberParticipant#setActionBars 
    method.</li>
</ul>
