/**
 * A synchronize participant is a visual compoment that can be displayed within any
 * control (e.g. view, editor, dialog).  Typically a participant is used to show changes between 
 * local resources and variant states of those resources and allows the user to perform actions
 * to manipulate the changes. For example, a participant could show the relative synchronization
 * between local resources and those on an FTP server, or alternatively, between local
 * resources and local history.
 * <p>
 * When a participant is registered with the {@link ISynchronizeManager} it will automatically display 
 * in the <i>Synchronize View</i> and if the participant extension point
 * enabled <code>globalSynchronize</code> it will also appear in the global synchronize action
 * toolbar.
 * <p>
 * A participant is added to the workbench as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <code>synchronizeParticipant</code> extension is contributed to 
 * the team registry. This extension defines the participant id, name, icon, type, and 
 * participant class.
 * <li>The participant type is <code>static</code> it is automatically added
 * to the {@link ISynchronizeManager}.
 * <li>If a participant is not static, plug-in developers can add the participant to the 
 * manager via {@link ISynchronizeManager#addSynchronizeParticipants(ISynchronizeParticipant[]) and
 * remove it using {@link ISynchronizeManager#removeSynchronizeParticipants(ISynchronizeParticipant[]).
 * Note that you don't have to add the participant to the manager. You can instead create the
 * participant, display it, and then dispose of it yourself.
 * <li>For non-static participants you can configure the participant to support multiple instances. This will
 * allow multiple instances to be created and registered with the synchronize manager.
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>
 * Once a participant is added to the synchronize manager its lifecycle will be managed. On shutdown if
 * the <code>persistent</code> property is set, the participant will be asked to persist state via 
 * the <code>saveState()</code> method. At startup the <code>init()</code> method is called
 * with a handle to the state that was saved. The dispose method is called when the participant is
 * removed from the manager and at shutdown.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients are not intended to implement this interface. Instead, sublcass {@link AbstractSynchronizeParticpant}.
 * </p>
