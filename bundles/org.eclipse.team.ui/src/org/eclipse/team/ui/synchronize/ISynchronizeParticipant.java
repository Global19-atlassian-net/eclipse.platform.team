/**
 * A synchronize participant is shown in the <code>Synchronize View</code>. Typically
 * a participant will show changes between local resources and variant states of
 * those resources. For example, a participant could show the relative synchronization
 * between local resources and those on an FTP server, or alternatively, between local
 * resources and local history.
 * <p>
 * A participant is added to the Synchronize View in three steps:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>A <code>synchronizeParticipant</code> extension is contributed to 
 *      the team registry. This extension defines the participant id,
 *      name, icon, type, and participant class.</li>
 *  <li>The participant is included in the Synchronize View when the view is
 *      created if its type is <code>static</code>.</li>
 *  <li>If a participant is not static, plug-in developers can add the
 *      participant to the view by adding the participant via 
 *      {@link ISynchronizeManager#addSynchronizeParticipants(ISynchronizeParticipant[]) and
 *      remove it using {@link ISynchronizeManager#removeSynchronizeParticipants(ISynchronizeParticipant[]).
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A participant must create a page that will be displayed in the ISynchronizeView page 
 * book view. 
 * </p><p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
 * </p>
