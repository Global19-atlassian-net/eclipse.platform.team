/**
 * Here's a summary of the input determination scheme
 * <ol>
 * <li>Obtain selected mappings
 * <li>Project mappings onto resources using the appropriate
 * context(s) in order to obtain a set of ResourceTraverals
 * <li>Determine what model providers are interested in the targeted resources
 * <li>From those model providers, obtain the set of affected resource mappings
 * <li>If the original set is the same as the new set, we are done.
 * <li>if the set differs from the original selection, rerun the mapping process
 * for any new mappings
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>Only need to query model providers for mappings for new resources
 *     <li>If new mappings are obtained, 
 *     ask model provider to compress the mappings?
 *     <li>keep repeating until no new mappings or resources are added
 *     </ul> 
 * <li>Use model provider relationships to result?
 * <li>Display the original set and the new set with an explanation
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>The original set and final set may involve mappings from
 *     multiple providers.
 *     <li>The number of providers can be reduced by assuming that
 *     extending models can display the elements of extended models.
 *     Then we are only left with conflicting models.
 *     <li>Could use a content provider approach a.k.a. Common Navigator
 *     or component based approach
 *     </ul>
