/**
 * The steps of an load (replace with version or branch) operation are:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Obtain the selection to be operated on.
 * <li>Determine the projection of the selection onto resources
 * using resource mappings and traversals.
 * 		<ul>
 * 		<li>this will require traversal of remote only
 * 		</ul>
 * <li>Ensure that all affected mappings are known
 *      <ul>
 * 		<li>additional mappings may be included due to resource project
 *      (i.e. many-to-one case).
 *      <li>notify users of additional mappings that will be affected
 *      <li>this list must include locally changed model elements whose
 *      changes will be lost including any that were deleted.
 *      <li>this list could include changed remote elements that 
 *      will be received including additions
 * 		</ul>
 * <li>Perform the replace at the resource level
