/**
 * The purpose of this interface is to provide support for model level 
 * auto-merging. It is helpful in the
 * cases where a file may contain multiple model elements or a model element
 * consists of multiple files. It can also be used for cases where there is a
 * one-to-one mapping between model elements and files, although
 * <code>IStreamMerger</code> can also be used in that case.
 * 
 * Clients should group resource mappings by model provider and
 * then attempt to obtain a merger from the model provider
 * using the adaptable mechanism as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     Object o = mapping.getModelProvider().getAdapter(IResourceMappingMerger.class);
 *     if (o instanceof IResourceMappingMerger.class) {
 *        IResourceMappingMerger merger = (IResourceMappingMerger)o;
 *        ...
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If the model provider of the resource mappings does not adapt to 
 * <code>IResourceMappingMerger</code>, clients can obtain the merger
 * from the Resources model provider {@link org.eclipse.core.resources.mapping.ResourceModelProvider}
 * and use that.
 * TODO: This is OK for now but will need to change
 * 
 * @see org.eclipse.compare.IStreamMerger

	 * Attempt to automatically merge the mappings of the merge context(<code>MergeContext#getMappings()</code>).
	 * The merge context provides access to the out-of-sync resources (<code>MergeContext#getSyncInfoTree()</code>)
	 * associated with the mappings to be merged. The set of provided mappings
	 * may come from multiple model providers. A particular implementation of
	 * this interface should only merge the mappings associated with their model
	 * provider. Also, the set of resources may contain additional resources
	 * that are not part of the mappings being merged. Implementors of this
	 * interface should use the mappings to determine which resources to merge
	 * and what additional semantics can be used to attempt the merge.
	 * <p>
	 * The type of merge to be performed depends on what is returned by the
	 * <code>MergeContext#getType()</code> method. If the type is
	 * <code>MergeContext.TWO_WAY</code> the merge will replace the local
	 * contents with the remote contents, ignoring any local changes. For
	 * <code>THREE_WAY</code>, the base is used to attempt to merge remote
	 * changes with local changes.
	 * <p>
	 * If merging was not possible for one or more of the mappings to which this
	 * merge applies, these mappings should be returned in an
	 * <code>MergeStatus</code> whose code is
	 * <code>MergeStatus.CONFLICTS</code> and which provides access to the
	 * mappings which could not be merged. Note that it is up to the model to
	 * decide whether it wants to break one of the provided resource mappings
	 * into several sub-mappings and attempt auto-merging at that level.
	 * 
	 * @param mappings the set of resource mappings being merged
	 * @param mergeContext a context that provides access to the resources
	 *            involved in the merge. The context must not be
	 *            <code>null</code>.
	 * @param monitor a progress monitor
	 * @return a status indicating the results of the operation. A code of
	 *         <code>MergeStatus.CONFLICTS</code> indicates that some or all
	 *         of the resource mappings could not be merged. The mappings that
	 *         were not merged are available using
	 *         <code>MergeStatus#getConflictingMappings()</code>
