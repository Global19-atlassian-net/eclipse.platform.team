 core
======================
SyncInfo
- represents relative sync of local and remote gives access to resources

TeamSubscriber
- creates sync infos

SyncInfoSet/MutableSyncInfoSet (optimized collection of sync infos - immutable)

SyncInfoFilter (filtering of sync sets used by actions and creation of sync sets)

SyncInfoCollector (collects sync infos from subscriber, and optionally from workspace. Uses background thread to collect and calculate changes. Is updated automatically with changes)

FilteredSyncInfoSet (filters a provided sync info set with a given filter and possible roots)

======================
 ui
======================

ISynchronizeManager (manages the lifesycle of synchronize participants)

ISynchronizeView

ISynchronizeParticipant (shows in the sync view, has a mode, working set, and creates a page with the UI pieces)

Modes in sync view (DirectionFilterActionGroup)

SyncInfoSetCompareConfiguration (encapsulates navigation, menus, content, label providers)this
                                is used to configure a viewer in different ways based on it's use.

SyncInfoDiffTreeViewer/SyncInfoDiffCheckboxViewer (shows diff nodes)

SyncInfoDiffNode -> DiffNode

SyncInfoSetCompareInput



DiffNode
SyncInfoDiffNode
SyncInfoDiffNodeRoot

Viewer
ContentProvider
Sorter
LabelProvider

1. sync set is created
2. decide how to model the sync set (hierachy, compressed, change log...) sorter...
3. hook up chagnen listener
4. ensure model doesn't change while building it?
5. update model dynamically
6. dispose of listener when input changes

SuperCharged MVC
================

View (viewers) -> view configurators (menus, content provider, label provider, controller)

Model (diff nodes) logical structure of sync info

Controller (creates model, keeps it up-to-date, sorter)

Data (sync info)
