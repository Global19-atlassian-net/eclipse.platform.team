Application programming interfaces for generating and refreshing synchronization 
state. 
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package specifies the API for Team subscribers. A Subscriber provides 
  access to the synchronization state between the local workspace resources and 
  a remote location, whether it be a code repository or some other type of server 
  (e.g. FTP). A subscriber is typically associated with only a subset of the resources 
  in the local workspace, referred to as the set of resources the subscriber supervises. 
  The supervised local resources have a corresponding remote state which describes 
  the state of the remote resources that correspond to the local resources.</p>
<p>A Subscriber provides:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a set of root resources that define the subset of resources in the workspace 
    that the subscriber supervises (some children of the roots may not be supervised, 
    as indicated by the isSupervised method).</li>
  <li>access to the synchronization state (using SyncInfo) between the resources 
    it supervises and their corresponding remote resources.</li>
  <li> the ability to refresh the the remote state</li>
  <li>change notification to registered listeners (of type ISubscriberChangeListener) 
    when the remote state changes or when roots are added or removed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Implementing a Subscriber </h3>
<p>The subsciber maintains the synchronization state between its locla resources 
  and their corresponding remotes.</p>
<p>fetch the remote states (during a refresh)</p>
<p>cache them locally (including state for files that do not exists locally)</p>
<p>notify listeners of changes</p>
<p>provide access to the cached state via members and getSyncInfo</p>
<h3>Additional Classes</h3>
<p>The SubscriberSyncInfoCollector is used to collect the SyncInfo for out-of-sync 
  resources from a subscriber into a SyncInfoTree that can be used to, for example, 
  display the out-of-sync resources of a subscriber to the user. The collector 
  supports filtering by working set and SyncInfoFilter (e.g. to select groupings 
  such as incoming-changes or conflicts). Even when filtered, the collector still 
  maintains a set of all out-of-sync resources from the subscriber in order to 
  provide statistics on the number of pre and post filtered out-of-sync resources.</p>
<p>FilteredSyncInfoCollector: should be generalized</p>
