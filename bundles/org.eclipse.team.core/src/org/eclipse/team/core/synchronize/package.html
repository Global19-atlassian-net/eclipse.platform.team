Application programming interfaces for managing synchronization state. 
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package specifies the API for managing the synchronization state between 
  the local workspace and a corresponding remote workspace. The classes in this 
  package can be used by Subscribers (see the org.eclipse.team.core.subscribers 
  package) or others. The classes are roughly divided into three categories: describing 
  the synchronization state of a single resource, describing the synchronization 
  state of a collection of resources and notifying interested parties of changes 
  in the synchronization state.</p>
<h3>Describing the synchronization state of a single resource</h3>
<p>The following classes are provided in order to map a local resource to its 
  corresponding remote resource and, for the case of a three-way compare, base 
  resource.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SyncInfo: node which maps a local resource to a corresponding remote resource 
    (and a base resource for three-way compare) and descibes the synchronization 
    state of those resources (e.g. in-sync or incoming-change).</li>
  <li>IRemoteResource: interface used by SyncInfo to access information about 
    a remote resource, such as it's name, its type (file or container) and its 
    contents.</li>
  <li>IRemoteResourceComparator: interface used by SyncInfo to indicate whether 
    the comparison to be used is two-way or three-way and to compare either a 
    local resource with a remote resource or, in the case of a three-way compare, 
    two remote resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Describing the synchronization state of a collection of resources</h3>
<p>The following classes are provided to accumulate multiple SyncInfo and to filter 
  the accumulated set based on some selection criteria.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SyncInfoSet: a set which contains the out-of-sync SyncInfo for multiple 
    local resources.</li>
  <li>SyncInfoTree: a specialized set optimized for hierarchical resource based 
    access (e.g. to obtain all out-of-sync children of a particular local resource).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notifying interested parties of sync info set changes</h3>
<p>Interested parties can register with a SyncInfoSet in order to receive notification 
  when a set changes.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ISyncInfoSetChangeListener: implementors of this interface can be registered 
    with a SyncInfoSet in order to recieve notification when the contents of the 
    set change.</li>
  <li>ISyncInfoSetChangeEvent: the type of the events generated by a SyncInfoSet</li>
  <li>ISyncInfoTreeChangeEvent: specialized ISyncInfoSetChangeEvent generated 
    by SyncInfoTree which includes notification of resource subtree aditions and 
    removals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional classes</h3>
<p>There are also some additional classes provided to help manage SyncInfoSets</p>
<ul>
  <li>SyncInfoFilter: a filter that can be used to test SyncInfo. Long running 
    tests are supported via an IProgressMonitor. SyncInfoSet has API for selecting 
    and rejecting SyncInfo based on a provided filter.</li>
  <li>FastSyncInfoFilter: a specialized filter that does not support the ue of 
    a progress monitor</li>
</ul>
<p>Several common filters are provided as inner classes of the two filter classes 
  for doing synchronization state tests and filter compounding (and, or, not).</p>
