- given the constraint that an IModelElement can only return resources within one project, we could not use them
to model change sets.
- what are reasonable defaults for a IModelContext? 
- repositories actions will have to deal with non-existing resources. It is possible that they never cared.
- can you contribute a workbench adapter for a specific implementation element to get icon, label for imodelelements?
- before the operation is run you have to provide a progress monitor to the traversals?



Repository Provider Changes:
==================

TeamAction has a new method which will return the traversals for a given selection. The operation has to operate 
on the traversal, provide a context (e.g. there will be a default), and ensure that it handles non-existing resources.
