<h2>Team - File System Repository Provider Example</h2>
  
<h3>Introduction</h3>
  
<p> The File System Repository Provider shows how to define your own repository
provider. It shows how to override the RepositoryProvider class and register
this new class as  a repository provider using the Team extension point.
It also illustrates how to create and register a configuration wizard for
connecting a local project to a remote location and how to provide some custom
Team and Replace with menu items for simple Get and Put operations. In  addition
it also shows how to use the validate save/validate edit mechanism to support 
pessimistic providers.   </p>
<h3>Running the example</h3>
  To start using this example create a project and select Team &gt; Share
Project... from the project's popup menu. In the wizrd that opens, select
File System Example and click Next. Now enter the location in the local file
system where you would like to connect the project to. The Get and Put operations
in the Team menu will now transfer to and from the selected  location.
