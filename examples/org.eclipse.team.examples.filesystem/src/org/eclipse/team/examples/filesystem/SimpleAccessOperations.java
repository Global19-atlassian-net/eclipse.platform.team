 * This class represents provisional API.  Its here to allow experimentation with 3rd party tools
 * calling providers in a repository neutral manner.
 * 
 * A provider is not required to implement this API.
 * Implementers, and those who reference it, do so with the awareness that this class may be
 * removed or substantially changed at future times without warning.
 * 
 * The <code>SimpleAccessOperations</code> class exposes a basic repository model that
 * providers may implement to allow third-party plugins to perform repository operations
 * programmatically. For example, a code generation tool may want to get source
 * files before generating the code, and check-in the results.  If a provider plugin does
 * not adhere to the <i>semantics</i> of the <code>SimpleAccessOperations</code> class
 * as described, they are free to opt out of implementing it.
